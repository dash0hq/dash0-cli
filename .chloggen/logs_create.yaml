  This is the first step in a larger effort to add support for logs in the `dash0` CLI.
  The `dash0 logs create` command allows users to create log records from the CLI, which can be useful for integration in CI/CD and other automation workflows.
  The `scope` name and version are hard-coded to `dash0-cli` and the version of the `dash0` binary.
