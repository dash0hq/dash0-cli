  Hidden files and directories (starting with `.`) are automatically skipped.
  All documents across all files are validated before any are applied; if any document fails validation, no changes are made.
  The apply output now includes asset IDs alongside names, and when applying from a directory, each line is prefixed with the relative file path.
  Dry-run output groups documents by file and shows file and document counts.

# If your change doesn't affect end users or the exported elements of any package,
# you should instead start your pull request title with "chore" or use the "Skip Changelog" label.
# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
